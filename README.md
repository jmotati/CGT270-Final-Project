By: Jitesh Motati, Josh Knull, Richard Wu
Study on correlation between statstics used to measure performance and team win percentage in the NBA.

## Abstract
The topic we decide to explore relates to how various statistics used to measure performance in the NBA correlates with team success. The intended audience includes basketball enthusiasts and sports analysts as they can utilize the findings to draw conclusions in a more accurate manner. Prior work has been done on a topic similar to ours by Yuanhao Yang who studied the correlation between individual player’s performance and their team’s success level. The variables used in Yang’s study revolves around normal statistics such as points, rebounds, and assists. Together as a group, we believe that these statistics do not accurately represent the value of individual players and their impact on the game. Therefore, we think our work is necessary as it provides more insight on team success by analyzing in-depth performance-related variables such as efficiency ratings and field goal percentages. The result of this project is significant to its intended audience because it provides insight on effective team compositions, assists analysts to provide more accurate analysis of teams, and helps organizations to trade players and formulate their teams in an efficient way.
